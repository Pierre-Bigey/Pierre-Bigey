# Hi there 👋, I'm Pierre Bigey!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate engineering student based in France, currently studying at IMT Atlantique. 
I've been exploring the world of programming since a young age, starting with **C** and expanding my skills to include 
**Java**, **Python**, and more. Here's a bit more about me:

## 🚀 About Me

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally. Here is a 
non-exhaustive list of my interests and skills:

- 🌐 I have a diverse informatic skill set that includes languages such as **Python**, **Java**, **C**, and **C#**. I'm familiar with:
  - Web development : **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **Angular**, **JavaEE**
  - Database administration **PostgreSQL**,** Flyway**
  - CI and devops tools : **Ansible**, **Gitlab CI/CD **and** Docker**
  - Machine learning libraries : **pytorch**, **scikit-learn**, **pandas**
- 🐛I like to learn cybersecurity and taking place to **CTF**. My best experience was the [404CTF 2024](https://www.404ctf.fr/),
- co-organized by the [DGSE](https://www.dgse.gouv.fr/fr), where I finished in the **top 100**. 
- 💻 I'm experienced with **Unity** engine and **C#**, with expertise in XR applications and interaction design. I've 
- developed app with network features, for PC, mobile and XR headsets (Meta Quest, Hololens). Some of the app 
- 🧮 As a math lover, I enjoy the logical challenges that programming presents and often find elegant solutions rooted 
- in mathematical principles.
- 🎮 I love creating new games and applications, and I'm always looking for new projects to work on.


## 🌐 Projects

1. **Hungry Worm**
   - A 2D mobile game developed in Unity where the player controls a worm that must eat humans to survive. The inspiration comes
from a flash game I played as a child called 'Effing Worms' [repo here](https://github.com/Pierre-Bigey/HungryWorm) *README missing*.

2. **Beat the Skeletons**
   - In winter 2022, after completing the basic pathway on Unity Learn, I decided to create a first game. It's a beat them all 
   where you have to kill skeletons. It allowed me to learn more about animations, sound integration and light on Unity [repo here](https://github.com/Pierre-Bigey/Beat-the-skeletons).

3. **Paper Please VR**
   - A virtual reality adaptation of the renowned game 'Paper Please', my first VR game [repo here](https://github.com/Pierre-Bigey/PaperPleaseVR).
*development suspended*.

4. **TRON't Stop Me Now**
    - A 3D game developed in Unity where the player controls a light cycle and must avoid crashing into walls or other players. 
Developped in collaboration during a Unity class [repo here](https://github.com/Pierre-Bigey/Tron-t-Stop-Me-Now).

5. **CoWalkVR**
   - An innovative VR application allowing two individuals to walk together in a natural environment for walk-and-talk 
interviews [repo here](https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/ls2n-vr/MarcheRV).

6. **Prometea**
   - Prometea is an ecological VR environment designed in collaboration with Nantes University clinical psychologists 
for prospective memory testing. The application prompts patients to remember both intention and time-based tasks, 
placing them in a virtual shopping center where they must perform these tasks. [repo here](https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/ls2n-vr/memoireprospective).

7. **Genetic Algorithm to play Snake**
   - To put my knowledge of machien learning into practice, I tried to create a genetic algorithm to play the game Snake [repo here](https://github.com/Pierre-Bigey/SnakeBot).
   

## 🍳 Hobbies and Interests

Apart from coding, I love:
- 🍲 Cooking up delicious dishes
- 🗣 Engaging in conversations about society and thought-provoking topics
- 🔧 Exploring crafting in electronics, woodworking, and mechanics

## 🎯 Goals

My primary goal is to find joy in IT development, collaborate effectively in a team, and create meaningful products.
